# SynthDefs

---

#  Basic concept: Instances of an instrument

* One synthesizer per note
* Only exists in that lifetime
* Efficiency

---

# See instantiation in action

You can follow the spawning of synths by running `s.plotTree`

```supercollider
(
// Play random pattern
Pbind(\degree, Pwhite(0,10)).play;
// Look at the node tree to see the synths spawned
s.plotTree;
)
```

# SynthDef vs. Synth

Imagine a cookie.

A [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) is the recipe for the cookie.

A [Synth](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Synth.html) is one of the actual cookies.

---

# What's in a SynthDef?

Unit generators aka.a UGens.

Building blocks that generate or modify signals of all kinds.

SuperCollider [comes with over 1000 over them](https://doc.sccode.org/Browse.html#UGens) if you have sc3-plugins installed. 

--- 

# Skeleton of a SynthDef

A SynthDef is declared by adding a name (`\name` below) and a function (`{}` braces) containing a synthesizer patch.
```
SynthDef(\name, {}).add 
```
---
# Playing a synthdef 

It can be useful while testing to be able to play the SynthDef. 

Use the `.play` message to do this.

```
SynthDef(\name, {}).play

```
---
# Adding a synthdef to the server

Use the `.add` message to add a synthdef to the server and make it available for the sound engine.

```
SynthDef(\name, { arg freq;
	// ...
}) 

```
---

# UGen rates

* `.ar` â€“ Audio rate
* `.kr` - Control rate 
	* Lower "resolution" 
	* more effective 
	* Used for LFOs, modulators etc.
* `.ir` - Initial rate (aka. Scalar) 
	* Set once on initialization and can't be changed
	* Used for [SampleRate](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SampleRate.html) etc.

---

# Variables

Variables are defined using the `var` keyword. 

They can contain data and/or UGens:

```supercollider
// A variable containing our frequency
var freq = 100;

// A variable containing our signal
var sig = SinOsc.ar(freq);

// Overwrite the signal with a version that has half the amplitude
sig = sig * 0.5;

```

---
# Arguments

The interface of your Synth.

Each argument you add will be controllable from a pattern.

---
# Argument defaults

Sometimes it's sensible to have a default value

---

# When to use arguments and when to use variables?

* Arguments are your instruments interface
	* The keys, knobs and buttons of a synthesizer
* Variables are internal to your instrument
	* The circuit boards inside of a synthesizer

---

# Outputting sound

Use [Out.ar](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Out.html) to output sound from a synth

```supercollider
var sig = WhiteNoise.ar();
Out.ar(0, sig);

```
---

# Got problems? Poll them!

The most important tool for debugging synths is [poll](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Poll.html). Use it by attaching `.poll` to the part of your synth you want to debug.

```
(
SynthDef(\problematic, {
    WhiteNoise.kr().poll
}).play
)
```

---

# Let's make a SynthDef!

``` 
SynthDef(\sawtooth, {
	// Arguments
	arg freq=442, cutoff=500, amp=0.5, out=0;
	// The sound generator
	var sig = Saw.ar(freq);

	// Scale amplitude
	sig = sig * amp;

	// Filter high frequencies
	sig = LPF.ar(sig, cutoff);

	Out.ar(out, sig)

}).play;
```

---

# Adding an envelope and duration

``` 
// Kill synth when done
var done = 2; 
// Percussive envelope
var env = Env.perc(attack, decay);
env = env.kr(done, gate, dur);

...

sig = sig * env;
Out.ar(out, sig )
```

Hint: Don't forget to add `attack`, `decay`, `gate` and `dur` to list of arguments.

---
```
SynthDef(\sawtooth, {
	// Arguments
	arg freq=442, cutoff=500, amp=0.5, out=0, attack=0.001, decay=0.99, dur=1, gate=1;

	// Kill synth when done
	var done = 2; 
	// Percussive envelope
	var env = Env.perc(attack, decay).kr(done, gate, dur);

	// The sound generator
	var sig = Saw.ar(freq);

	// Scale amplitude and apply envelope
	sig = sig * amp * env;

	// Filter high frequencies
	sig = LPF.ar(sig, cutoff);

	Out.ar(out, sig)

}).play;
```

# Exercise: Modify your Synth!

Try changing your SynthDef by exchanging the `Saw` to another type of oscillator. 

[Browse the help system](https://doc.sccode.org/Browse.html#UGens%3EGenerators%3EDeterministic) to find a replacement.

**Hint:** [Pulse](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Pulse.html), [DPW3Tri](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/DPW3Tri.html) and [SinOscFB](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SinOscFB.html) are fun alternatives.

_Make sure to read the help files._
